# A* RPG Pathfinding Demo

This project demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm in a simple, grid-based RPG-like environment. It provides an interactive web interface where users can set start and end points, create obstacles, and visualize how the A* algorithm finds the optimal path.

## Features

- Interactive 20x20 grid
- Set start and end points
- Create and remove obstacles
- Visualize the A* algorithm's path-finding process
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Click to set the start point (green)
4. Click again to set the end point (red)
5. Hold Ctrl and click to add or remove obstacles (black)
6. Click "Find Path" to run the A* algorithm
7. Click "Reset" to clear the grid and start over
