# astar-rpg-pathfinding-demo
A simple, interactive web-based demonstration of the A* pathfinding algorithm in a grid-based RPG-like environment. This project visualizes how A* efficiently finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles, simulating character movement in a 2D game world.
